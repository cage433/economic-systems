Economic system modelling 
=========================

An attempt to investigate various economic models, a la Steve Keen's Minsky, yet without any attempt to integrate the UI.

The systems themselves seem fairly simple, and modelling them over time fairly trivial. Intention is design a language that can describe a system, using Godley tables for correctness, producing output that can be consumed by separage graphing tools.
